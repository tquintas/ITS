    abstract = {Many online and mobile applications rely on daily emails and push notifications to increase and maintain user engagement. The multi-armed bandit approach provides a useful framework for optimizing the content of these notifications, but a number of complications (such as novelty effects and conditional eligibility) make conventional bandit algorithms unsuitable in practice. In this paper, we introduce the Recovering Difference Softmax Algorithm to address the particular challenges of this problem domain, and use it to successfully optimize millions of daily reminders for the online language-learning app Duolingo. This lead to a 0.5\%. increase in total daily active users (DAUs) and a 2\%, increase in new user retention over a strong baseline. We provide technical details of its design and deployment, and demonstrate its efficacy through both offline and online evaluation experiments.},

    ABSTRACT = {In this experimental study, an intelligent tutoring system called the fuzzy Bayesian intelligent tutoring system (FB-ITS), is developed by using artificial intelligence methods based on fuzzy logic and the Bayesian network technique to adaptively support students in learning environments. The effectiveness of the FB-ITS was evaluated by comparing it with two other versions of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), fuzzy ITS and Bayesian ITS, separately. Moreover, it was evaluated by comparing it with an existing traditional e-learning system. In order to evaluate whether the academic performance of the students in different learning groups differs or not, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used based on the students&rsquo; pre-test and post-test scores. The study was conducted with 120 undergraduate university students. Results showed that students who studied using FB-ITS had significantly higher academic performance on average compared to other students who studied with the other systems. Regarding the time taken to perform the post-test, the results indicated that students who used the FB-ITS needed less time on average compared to students who used the traditional e-learning system. From the results, it could be concluded that the new system contributed in terms of the speed of performing the final exam and high academic success.},

    abstract = {Assessing knowledge acquisition by the student is the primary task of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). Assessment is needed to adapt learning materials and activities to student's capacities. In this paper, a proposal to infer the level of knowledge possessed by the student is presented. A general structure of an ITS is shown, an evaluation module based on Bayesian network is proposed. The module mainly based on a test was implemented to know what student knows. During the test, the software system chooses the new questions based on the responses to the previous ones, that is, the software system makes an adaption in real time. A network of concepts was used to get the inferences, which contains the relationships between concepts. Evaluation module could infer many questions and concepts through the relations and the probabilistic inference of the Bayesian network. It information easily can be used to reinforce weak topics in order to cover the student's needs. Given the positive evidence is considered that testing the rest of variable examined in the Bayesian network can provide better accurate in the diagnostic of student’ knowledge possession.}
